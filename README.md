# Catering Website

## Aim

The aim of this project is to turn a UI/UX design into a functional website using React JS.
By doing this, I want to improve my coding skills and gain more experience.
Through this project I want to achieve following:

- Improve my front-end development skills: I want to gain experience with React js and Sass by
  designing and building an attractive and user-friendly website that showcases my catering services.
- Translate a design into code: By working with an existing design, I hope to improve my skills in
  translating UI/UX design into code. This will help me develop a better understanding of how to create
  websites that are not only beatiful but also functional and user-friendly
- Develop a portfolio piece: I plan to use this website as part of my portfolioto showcase my skills to
  potential clients and employers. By turning a design into a website, I hope to demonstrate my ability
  to design and develop beatiful and responsive user interfaces.
- Improve my API integration skills : By using WordPress blog as part of my website, I hope to improve my
  skills in integrating third-party APIs into my projects. This will help me develop better understanding
  of how to create websites that rely on external data sources, which is important skill for modern web design.

## Dependencies

This project uses the Yarn package manage depencies. I prefer to use Yarn because it is fast and reliable tool
for installing and managing packages, and it provides number of advantages over other package managers.

You need to install the dependencies by using `yarn install` command
By using yarn I am ensure that my project's dependencies are up to date and that the installation process
fast and efficient.If you have any questions or issues with the installation process, please refer to the
Yarn documentation or open an issue on this project's GitHub repository.
